#	This file contains dictionary translations for parsing
#	requests and generating responses.  All transactions are
#	composed of Attribute/Value Pairs.  The value of each attribute
#	is specified as one of 4 data types.  Valid data types are:
#
#	string  - 0-253 octets
#	ipaddr  - 4 octets in network byte order
#	integer - 32 bit value in big endian order (high byte first)
#	date    - 32 bit value in big endian order - seconds since
#					00:00:00 GMT,  Jan.  1,  1970
#
#	FreeRADIUS includes extended data types which are not defined
#	in RFC 2865 or RFC 2866.  These data types are:
#
#	abinary - Ascend's binary filter format.
#	octets  - raw octets, printed and input as hex strings.
#		  e.g.: 0x123456789abcdef
#
#
#	Enumerated values are stored in the user file with dictionary
#	VALUE translations for easy administration.
#
#	Example:
#
#	ATTRIBUTE	  VALUE
#	---------------   -----
#	Framed-Protocol = PPP
#	7		= 1	(integer encoding)
#

#
#	Include compatibility dictionary for older users file. Move this
#	directive to the end of the file if you want to see the old names
#	in the logfiles too.
#

#
#	Following are the proper new names. Use these.
